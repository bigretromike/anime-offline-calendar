On the opposite side of town, a boring high school teacher is met with a startling confession and an equally unexpected encounter with his family. A lonely girl who lives with a ghostly house guest meets the (living and breathing) man she could be destined to marry, while twin boys who don't quite see eye to eye encounter love and lust in the most unexpected of situations. Take a moment to sit back and watch life through the eyes of these ordinary people, a series of happy-go-lucky days colored by intersecting lines of sex, love, and longing.<br /><br /><i>Source: Digital Manga Guild</i>", "extra": "<a href=\"/creator/46372\">Liden Films Kyoto Studio</a>", "general": "Movie, 1 ep"}], "2020-05-15": [{"aid": "14642", "name": "Cider no You ni Kotoba ga Wakiagaru", "kanji": "", "image": "https://cdn-eu.anidb.net/images/150/244620.jpg-thumb.jpg", "ep": "", "desc": "", "extra": "<a href=\"/creator/43312\">Signal MD</a>, <a href=\"/creator/37026\">Sublimation</a>", "general": "Movie, 1 ep"}], "2020-05-16": [{"aid": "15102", "name": "Eiga Given", "kanji": "", "image": "https://cdn-eu.anidb.net/images/150/244440.jpg-thumb.jpg", "ep": "", "desc": "* Based on a BL music manga series by <a href=\"https://anidb.net/cr57629\">Kizu Natsuki</a>.", "extra": "<a href=\"/creator/27220\">Lerche</a>", "general": "Movie, 1 ep"}, {"aid": "15204", "name": "Eiga Precure Miracle Leap: Minna to no Fushigi na Ichinichi", "kanji": "", "image": "https://cdn-eu.anidb.net/images/150/242477.jpg-thumb.jpg", "ep": "", "desc": "", "extra": "", "general": "Movie, 1 ep"}], "2020-05-29": [{"aid": "14883", "name": "Omoi, Omoware, Furi, Furare", "kanji": "", "image": "https://cdn-eu.anidb.net/images/150/241936.jpg-thumb.jpg", "ep": "", "desc": "* Based on a romance shoujo manga series by <a href=\"https://anidb.net/cr37501\">Sakisaka Io</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://anidb.net/ch107406\">Ichihara Yuna</a> is in the spring before her first year of high school and is pained to be separated from her best friend Sacchan who is moving away.

The heroine, Jun Jiu, relies on her exquisite medical skills to save lives and help the injured, and struggles to train in a world where strength is everything. She is brave, intelligent, resilient and cunning, and will not frown in the face of any enemy, no matter how fierce they are. As the saying goes, \"the poor and the strong do not fall short of their ambition\", and she uses her bravery and hard work to create one miracle after another on the path of enlightenment. She is a generous but not saintly woman who is not soft on evil people, and who is willing to put herself in harm's way when it comes to her friends. This is not just a story about the adventure of rebirth, unlike other chaotic and murderous fantasy stories, it is a fantasy world full of flesh and blood and goodwill.<br /><br /><i>source: baike.baidu.com/DeepL.com</i>", "extra": "", "general": "Web, 60 eps"}]}}

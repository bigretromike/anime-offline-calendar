Japanese people believe that gods dwell in various things. There are gods of the water, wood, and even gods that keep us safe from the virus. Every October, thousands of gods leave their places of residence to gather in the Izumo region to have a conference. As such, October is also called Kamiari month\u2014 only in the Izumo region\u2014 which means the month with gods, and Kannazuki\u2014 in every other region\u2014 which means the month without gods.<br /><br /><i>Source: crunchyroll</i>", "extra": "", "general": "Movie, 1 ep"}, {"aid": "15936", "name": "Platinum End", "kanji": "", "image": "", "ep": "", "desc": "* Based on a supernatural thriller manga written by <a href=\"https://anidb.net/cr1498\">Ooba Tsugumi</a> and drawn by <a href=\"https://anidb.net/cr1499\">Obata Takeshi</a>.<br /><br />As his classmates celebrate their middle school graduation, troubled <a href=\"https://anidb.net/ch115133\">Mirai</a> is mired in darkness.

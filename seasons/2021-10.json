The meteorite produced grotesque monsters called D2, which started running rampant. D2 very quickly banned all music, which was the one thing able to overcome them. But there were some people who resisted the D2. They are young women who hold the power of music, the \"Musicart.\" These young women hold \"scores\" that are able to defeat the monsters. And there are also people who lead these women, known as Conductors.<br /><br />The anime takes place in America in the year 2047, which has fallen to ruin thanks to the D2. <a href=\"https://anidb.net/ch118157\">Takt</a>, a Conductor, is partnered with a Musicart named <a href=\"https://anidb.net/ch118158\">Unmei</a>. Takt yearns for music to be returned to the world, and Unmei wishes to destroy the D2. Their aim is to travel to New York.<br /><br /><i>Source: ANN</i>", "extra": "", "general": "TV Series"}], "2021-10-07": [{"aid": "14291", "name": "Sakugan", "kanji": "", "image": "", "ep": "", "desc": "The distant future, long after the Western calendar is no longer used. Humans live shoulder-to-shoulder, cramped in the \"Labyrinth,\" an underground world deep below the surface. There are many colonies where people live in the underground Labyrinth. The place is known for extreme high temperatures, but also for lodes of gold, silver, and other riches. In one of the colonies named Pin-in, a curious nine-year-old girl named <a href=\"https://anidb.net/ch114301\">Memempu</a> and her father <a href=\"https://anidb.net/ch114299\">Gagumber</a> board a two-person work robot and mine for ore. They eke a living as the lowest of lowest \"Worker\" occupations.<br /><br />One day, Memempu begs her father Gagumber to set out as Markers \u2014 those who chart the innards of the Labyrinth as a spelunker \u2014 to search for her mother who left their home. If they encounter a \"mysterious giant creature\" lurking in the caves, the survival rate is less than 5%. Since discovering an unknown world is dangerous work, \"maps\" hold great value in the world of Labyrinth and fetch high prices on the market. A Marker is the most dangerous, but also the most lucrative, job. Gagumber decides he cannot hold back the ever-curious Memempu from going off on her own countless times, and finally gives in. The two embark on a journey together in the work robot.<br /><br />However, the \"cost\" of curiosity... The \"truth\" they finally uncovered...<br /><br />This is a father and daughter's epic journey with the theme of family love.<br /><br /><i>Source: ANN</i><br /><br /><i>Note 1: The runner-up for the \"Science-Fiction/Robot\" category of the Project Anima.<br />Note 2: The first episode premiered on Crunchyroll Expo Online on August 5 PT.</i>", "extra": "<a href=\"/creator/1043\">Satelight</a>", "general": "TV Series"}], "2021-10-08": [{"aid": "15936", "name": "Platinum End", "kanji": "", "image": "", "ep": "", "desc": "* Based on a supernatural thriller manga written by <a href=\"https://anidb.net/cr1498\">Ooba Tsugumi</a> and drawn by <a href=\"https://anidb.net/cr1499\">Obata Takeshi</a>.<br /><br />As his classmates celebrate their middle school graduation, troubled <a href=\"https://anidb.net/ch115133\">Mirai</a> is mired in darkness.

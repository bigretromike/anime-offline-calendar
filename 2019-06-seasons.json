Mutsumi found the other survivors, and used her wilderness knowledge to help them. She expects that they will be rescued in about three days, which doesn't seem so long to endure. However, she didn't account for the fact that the island is populated with gigantic killer insects. Her knowledge of butterflies, wasps, and more may be the only thing that will help any of her classmates survive to be rescued.<br /><br /><i>Source: MangaHelpers via M-U</i><br /><br /><i>Note: Bundled with manga's 6th volume.</i>", "extra": "<a href=\"/creator/57290\">Twilight Studio</a>", "general": "Movie, 1 ep"}], "2019-06-28": [{"aid": "14507", "name": "7 Seeds", "kanji": "", "image": "https://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/thumbs/150/227168.jpg-thumb.jpg", "ep": "", "desc": "* Based on a sci-fi shoujo manga drawn by <a href=\"https://anidb.net/cr6359\">Tamura Yumi</a>.

All living organisms, including mankind, have been wiped off the face of the planet. The government, who had foreseen this outcome, took measures to counter the worst-case scenario. In particular was Project \"7 SEEDS\", in which five sets of seven gifted young men and women were carefully selected and placed into teams (Spring, Summer A, Summer B, Autumn and Winter). Each participant was then put under cryogenic sleep in hopes of preserving the continued existence of mankind.<br />When those men and women awoke, they found themselves suddenly thrust into a cruel world.
